# Real Estate Investment Advisor - Quick Project (Super-fast + Full structure)

This package contains the essential code to submit the project quickly.
It includes:
- `india_housing_prices_sample.csv` — small sample dataset (so app & training can run immediately)
- `train.py` — minimal training script that creates `models/` with a classifier and regressor
- `app.py` — Streamlit app to input property details and get predictions
- `models/` — contains trained models (generated by the packaging script)
- `requirements.txt` — required packages
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run (locally)
1. (Optional) If you have the real dataset `india_housing_prices.csv`, place it in the project root.
2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train models (if not already present):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

If you do not have the full dataset, the sample dataset included allows immediate testing.
